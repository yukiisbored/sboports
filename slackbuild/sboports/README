sboports (ports-like interface to slackbuilds.org)

sboports is a set of perl scripts providing a ports-like automation
interface to slackbuilds.org. Its features include requirement handling
and the ability to handle 32-bit and compat32 builds on multilib
x86_64 systems.

sboports bundles the required Perl module Sort::Versions with it. This does
not interfere with a copy installed from the CPAN, or from slackbuilds.org.

sbotools was written and maintained by d4wnr4z0r, xocel, and pink_mist. It is
now forked under the name sboports and maintained by sboports contributors.
