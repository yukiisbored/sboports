* sbotools 2.0 - 2016-07-02
  * Major new features
	* LOCAL_OVERRIDES setting

	  Allows to keep a directory with local slackbuild dirs that will override
	  whatever is found in the regular repository. #8 #13 #14 #15 #19 #20
	* SLACKWARE_VERSION setting

	  Allows to specify the slackware version to sync from SBo. Previously only
	  the version in your /etc/slackware-version was used for this, and if that
	  had gotten updated in -current, you'd have needed to wait both for a new
	  version of sbotools, as well as SBo to get the new repository online
	  before sbotools would work for you again. #19
	* REPO setting

	  This will override the SLACKWARE_VERSION setting. It's used to specify an
	  absolute URL for the SBo repository you want to sync with. #6 #19 #27
	* Use sbosrcarch source archive if download fails #7 #19 #24
	* sboupgrade --all option to upgrade everything listed by sbocheck. #9 #19
